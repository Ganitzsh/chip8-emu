# Chip-8 Emulator

This is yet another chip-8 emulator! In fact, I've always
wanted to code an emulator, I'm a big user of the ones for
recent consoles and it just fascinates me.

This is part of my journey of learning Rust, trying to get the basics right.
I'm also following a very good book, [Rust in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/rust-in-action), which elaborates on advanced concepts and things about the language.

## Getting started

If your environment is setup for Rust:
```
cargo run
```

For now the rom is hard-coded, but I'll make changes and this will
be addressed. In the meantime, feel free to edit it.
